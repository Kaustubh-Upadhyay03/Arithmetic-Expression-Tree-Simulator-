# Arithmetic-Expression-Tree-Simulator-

Building an expression tree of an arithmetic expression is something quite useful and it is one of the steps a compilers must take to generate machine code.

With that in mind, and inspired on my lectures on the tree data structure I decided to create a web app that simulates the creation of such a tree given an expression.

Visit this website to simulate an expression yourself.
